For example, if the current version of a browser is 24.x, we support the 24.x and 23.x versions.\r\n\r\n12.1x, (Current - 1) or Current denotes that we support Opera 12.1x as well as last 2 versions of Opera. For example, if the current Opera version is 20.x, we support Opera 12.1x, 19.x and 20.x but not Opera 15.x through 18.x.\r\n\r\nUnsupported Browsers\r\nWhile jQuery might run without major issues in older browser versions, we do not actively test jQuery in them and generally do not fix bugs that may appear in them.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, jQuery does not fix bugs in pre-release versions of browsers, such as beta or dev releases. If you find a bug with jQuery in a pre-release of a browser, you should report the bug to the browser vendor.\r\n\r\nAbout Browser Support\r\njQuery is constantly tested with all of its supported browsers via unit tests. However, a web page using jQuery may not work in the same set of browsers if its own code takes advantage of (or falls prey to) browser-specific behaviors. Testing is essential to fully support a browser. The modern.IE site makes available virtual machines for testing many different versions of Internet Explorer. Older versions of other browsers can be found at oldversion.com.\r\n\r\nOnly the most current version of jQuery is tested and updated to fix bugs or add features. Users of older versions that find a bug should upgrade to the latest released version to determine if the bug has already been fixed. The jQuery Migrate plugin may be helpful in identifying and fixing problems during a version upgrade.\r\n\r\nAbout CSS Selector Compatibility\r\nRegardless of a browser's support of CSS selectors, all selectors listed at api.jquery.com/category/selectors/ will return the correct set of elements when passed as an argument of the jQuery function.\r\n\r\nCSS styles applied with jQuery's .css() method are dependent on the browser's level of support. In general, jQuery does not attempt to overcome the limitations of a browser's style rendering. (One exception is opacity, which jQuery \"shims\" for older Internet Explorer's alternative implementation.) Furthermore, prior to version 1.8, jQuery does not normalize vendor-prefixed properties.\r\n\r\nExternal References\r\n\r\nCSS contents and browser compatibility\r\nComparison of layout engines (Cascading Style Sheets)\r\nAcid3","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
